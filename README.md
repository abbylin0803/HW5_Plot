Observation & Insight : 
1) Correlation efficiency between mouse weight and tumor volume is about 0.84 and it indicates that these two factores are strongly associated. We can make a bold assumption that, based on  what we observe in this sample, increasing weight will increase the possibility of having higher tumor size/volume. 
2) Gender % in this whole dataset is not skewed towards either way, 49% vs 51%. Tumor volumes is reported as normally distributed and the average tumor across the samples is 50.44(mm3). 
3) To look at numbe of different treatments that's been used to run the test, Capomulin ranks the first with 230 and Ramicane being the second one at 228. 
4) Top three drugs/treatments applied to the mouse are:	Capomulin,Ramicane, and Ketapril. However, their performance varies. See the table/line chart at the bottom of the script/code, Ketapril is not really decreasing the size of tumor while Ramicane and Capomulin are. Efficiency between Ramicane and Capomulin is pretty similar, but the average size of the tumor treated with Ramicane is slightly smaller towwards the end of the treatment than Capomulin.
