Observation & Insight : 
1) Correlation efficiency between mouse weight and tumor volume is about 0.84 and it indicates that these two factores are strongly associated. We can make a bold assumption that, based on  what we observe in this sample, increasing weight will increase the possibility of having higher tumor size/volume. 
2) Gender % in this whole dataset is not skewed towards either way, 49% vs 51%. Tumor volumes is reported as normally distributed and the average tumor across the samples is 50.44(mm3). 
3) To look at numbe of different treatments that's been used to run the test, Capomulin ranks the first with 230 and Ramicane being the second one at 228.
